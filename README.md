WHILONE Tech bootloader Host Beta 

Made by Cagri Arslanturk

The main aim of this project is to build an application that can send and receive data from the serial port.
Data can be transmitted with the WHILONE TECH's protocol and a file can be parsed and sent with the protocol. 
Received messages from the serial port can be stored in the machine as a txt or CSV file.
